In this exercise, we will be implementing linear regression and get to see it work
on data.

These files are to be completed and submitted

- warmUpExercise.m ---Simple example function in Octave/MATLAB
- plotData.m --- Function to display the dataset
- computeCost.m --- Function to compute the cost of linear regression
- gradientDescent.m --- Function to run gradient descent

This makes up the first programming assignment for the Course.
